# document-diagnosis

This repository describes a method for **structural review and diagnostic analysis of complex written documents**.

It is not copy-editing, proofreading, or stylistic polishing.  
It is an analytical intervention applied when a document’s **logic, structure, or internal coherence** is under strain.

## What “document diagnosis” means

Many high-stakes documents fail not because of poor grammar, but because:

- arguments are internally inconsistent
- key terms shift meaning across sections
- structure no longer matches intent
- multiple contributors have introduced misalignment
- conclusions depend on claims that are not properly supported

Document diagnosis treats a text as a system:  
examining how its parts interact, where meaning is distorted, and where decisions are implicitly being made by the structure itself.

---

## When this method is used

This approach is typically applied to:

- policy drafts and consultation documents  
- research reports and white papers  
- technical frameworks and guidance documents  
- long-form institutional communications  
- multi-author or iteratively revised texts  

Especially when the document:

- feels “overgrown” or opaque  
- resists simplification  
- has already passed through multiple review cycles  
- carries reputational, regulatory, or strategic weight  

---

## What the analysis focuses on

A diagnostic review may include:

- structural mapping of the document  
- identification of implicit assumptions  
- analysis of argument flow and dependency  
- detection of internal contradictions or category errors  
- alignment between stated purpose and actual structure  

The goal is **not to add content**, but to remove distortion so the document can do the work it is meant to do.

---

## Output

The outcome of a document diagnosis is typically:

- a structured written assessment  
- annotated observations (separate from the document text)  
- concrete recommendations for revision or restructuring  

No changes are made invisibly.  
All reasoning is explicit.

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.  
It serves as a public description of the method rather than an implementation.

Further material may be added as examples or analytical notes.

## How this is used

This repository describes a method, not a software tool.

Engagement typically proceeds as follows:

1. The client provides a draft document or section requiring review.
2. A diagnostic analysis is performed focusing on structure, logic, and internal coherence.
3. Findings are returned as a structured written assessment, separate from the source text.
4. Recommendations identify where meaning is distorted, assumptions are implicit, or arguments fail under pressure.

No edits are made directly to the document unless explicitly requested.
The purpose is diagnostic clarity, not stylistic polish.

This method is most effective when decisions depend on the document doing its work correctly.
