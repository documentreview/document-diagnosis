# document-diagnosis

**Structural review and diagnostic analysis of complex written documents.**

This repository describes a method (and an engagement format) for reviewing documents whose **logic, structure, or internal coherence** is under strain.

It is **not** copy-editing, proofreading, or stylistic polishing.  
It is a macro-level intervention focused on how meaning is carried by structure.

## What “document diagnosis” means

Many high-stakes documents fail not because of grammar, but because:

- arguments are internally inconsistent
- key terms shift meaning across sections
- structure no longer matches intent
- multiple contributors introduce misalignment
- conclusions depend on claims that are not properly supported

Document diagnosis treats a text as a system:  
examining how its parts interact, where meaning is distorted, and where decisions are implicitly being made by the structure itself.

---

## When this method is used

This approach is typically applied to:

- policy drafts and consultation documents
- research reports and white papers
- technical frameworks and guidance documents
- long-form institutional communications
- multi-author or iteratively revised texts

Especially when the document:

- feels “overgrown” or opaque
- resists simplification
- has already been through multiple review cycles
- carries reputational, regulatory, or strategic weight

---

## What the analysis focuses on

A document diagnosis may include:

- structural mapping of the document (what each part is doing)
- identification of implicit assumptions
- analysis of argument flow and dependency (what relies on what)
- detection of internal contradictions or category errors
- alignment between stated purpose and actual structure

The goal is not to add content, but to remove distortion so the document can do the work it is meant to do.

---

## Output

The outcome of a document diagnosis is typically a **separate diagnostic assessment**, such as:

- a structured account of the document’s purpose, structure, and logic
- identified failure points (where meaning, coherence, or alignment breaks)
- high-level options for resolving structural problems (without rewriting the text)
- notes on risk: where decisions may be made incorrectly because the document misleads

This is **not** line editing.  
By default, it does not involve rewriting sentences, tightening style, or polishing language.

## How this is used

This repository describes a method, not a software tool.

Engagement typically proceeds as follows:

1. The client provides a draft document (or a section requiring review).
2. A diagnosis is performed focusing on structure, logic, and coherence.
3. Findings are returned as a standalone assessment, separate from the source text.
4. If the client wants implementation support, that is handled as a **separate, explicit request** (scope is agreed before any in-text work begins).

## Example (anonymised)

An anonymised example output is included as a PDF:

- `examples/document-diagnosis-example.pdf`

The example is intentionally de-identified and provided to illustrate the *format* and *level* of analysis.

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.  
It serves as a public description of the method and a stable reference point for prospective clients.

Further material may be added as anonymised examples or analytical notes.
