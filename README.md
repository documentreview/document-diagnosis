# document-diagnosis

This repository describes a method for **structural review and diagnostic analysis of complex written documents**.

It is not copy-editing, proofreading, or stylistic polishing.  
It is an analytical intervention applied when a document’s **logic, structure, or internal coherence** is under strain.

## What “document diagnosis” means

Many high-stakes documents fail not because of poor grammar, but because:

- arguments are internally inconsistent
- key terms shift meaning across sections
- structure no longer matches intent
- multiple contributors have introduced misalignment
- conclusions depend on claims that are not properly supported

Document diagnosis treats a text as a system:  
examining how its parts interact, where meaning is distorted, and where decisions are implicitly being made by the structure itself.

## When this method is used

This approach is typically applied to:

- policy drafts and consultation documents  
- research reports and white papers  
- technical frameworks and guidance documents  
- long-form institutional communications  
- multi-author or iteratively revised texts  

Especially when the document:

- feels “overgrown” or opaque  
- resists simplification  
- has already passed through multiple review cycles  
- carries reputational, regulatory, or strategic weight  

---

## What the analysis focuses on

A diagnostic review may include:

- structural mapping of the document  
- identification of implicit assumptions  
- analysis of argument flow and dependency  
- detection of internal contradictions or category errors  
- alignment between stated purpose and actual structure  

The goal is **not to add content**, but to remove distortion so the document can do the work it is meant to do.

---

## Output

The outcome of a document diagnosis is typically:

- a structured written assessment  
- annotated observations (separate from the document text)  
- concrete recommendations for revision or restructuring  

No changes are made invisibly.  
All reasoning is explicit.

## Status

This repository is intentionally minimal.  
It serves as a public description of the method rather than an implementation.

Further material may be added as examples or analytical notes.
